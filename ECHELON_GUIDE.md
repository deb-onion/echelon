```

Let's explore each component in detail.

## Core Components

The core functionality is implemented in the `src/core` directory:

### Authentication System (`authentication.py`)

**Purpose**: Handles OAuth 2.0 authentication with Google Ads API.

**Key Functions**:
- `GoogleAdsAuthentication`: Main class that manages authentication
- `authenticate()`: Obtains or refreshes OAuth credentials
- `get_google_ads_client()`: Returns a configured API client
- `get_authenticated_client()`: Helper function to simplify authentication

**Use Case**:
Before accessing Google Ads data, you need to authenticate. This module manages the OAuth 2.0 flow, refreshes expired tokens, and stores credentials securely.

```python
# Example: Authenticating with Google Ads
from src.core.authentication import get_authenticated_client

client, account_id = get_authenticated_client(config_dir="config", account_id="123-456-7890")
# Now you can use the client to access Google Ads API
```

### API Client (`api_client.py`)

**Purpose**: Provides a standardized interface to the Google Ads API.

**Key Functions**:
- `GoogleAdsApiClient`: Main client class
- `execute_query()`: Executes GAQL (Google Ads Query Language) queries
- `get_campaign_list()`: Retrieves campaigns from the account
- `get_account_info()`: Gets basic information about the account

**Use Case**:
This is the main interface for retrieving data from Google Ads. It handles API versioning, service instantiation, and query execution.

```python
# Example: Getting a list of campaigns
from src.core.api_client import GoogleAdsApiClient

client = GoogleAdsApiClient(config_dir="config", account_id="123-456-7890")
campaigns = client.get_campaign_list(status_filter=["ENABLED"])
```

### Request Handler (`request_handler.py`)

**Purpose**: Manages API requests, rate limiting, and error handling.

**Key Functions**:
- `RateLimiter`: Implements token bucket algorithm for API request rate limiting
- `RequestHandler`: Manages retries, backoff, and error handling
- `with_retry`: Decorator to add retry logic to functions

**Use Case**:
Google Ads API has rate limits and can return temporary errors. This module ensures your requests stay within limits and handles retries.

```python
# Example: Using retry decorator
from src.core.request_handler import with_retry

@with_retry(max_retries=3, retry_delay=2.0)
def fetch_data(client, query):
    # This function will be retried up to 3 times if it fails
    return client.execute_query(query)
```

### Utilities (`utilities.py`)

**Purpose**: Provides common utility functions used throughout the system.

**Key Functions**:
- `setup_logging()`: Configures logging for the application
- `validate_customer_id()`: Validates Google Ads customer ID format
- `format_date()`: Standardizes date formatting
- `micros_to_currency()`: Converts micro amounts to regular currency

**Use Case**:
These utilities simplify repetitive tasks and ensure consistency across the application.

```python
# Example: Converting micros to currency
from src.core.utilities import micros_to_currency

# Google Ads returns monetary values in micros (millionths)
budget_micros = 50000000  # 50 USD in micros
budget = micros_to_currency(budget_micros)  # Returns 50.0
```

## AI Engine

The AI engine is the brain of Echelon, providing intelligent optimization recommendations:

### AI Optimizer (`ai_optimizer.py`)

**Purpose**: Analyzes campaign performance data and generates optimization recommendations.

**Key Functions**:
- `AICampaignOptimizer`: Main AI optimization class
- `train_models()`: Trains machine learning models on historical data
- `get_campaign_recommendations()`: Generates improvement suggestions
- `optimize_campaign()`: Applies optimizations (with human approval)

**Models Implemented**:
1. **Bid Optimization Model**: Suggests optimal CPA/CPC adjustments
2. **Budget Allocation Model**: Recommends budget changes based on performance
3. **Performance Prediction Model**: Forecasts future results with different settings

**Use Case**:
The AI engine analyzes performance patterns to identify opportunities. For example, if a campaign is spending too much per conversion, it might recommend reducing bids or targeting different keywords.

```python
# Example: Getting AI recommendations
from src.ai_engine.ai_optimizer import AICampaignOptimizer
from src.core.api_client import GoogleAdsApiClient

client = GoogleAdsApiClient(config_dir="config", account_id="123-456-7890")
optimizer = AICampaignOptimizer(client, model_dir="models")

# Get recommendations for a campaign
recommendations = optimizer.get_campaign_recommendations(campaign_id="1234567890")
print(f"Health Score: {recommendations['overall_health_score']}/100")
print(f"Suggested bid adjustment: {recommendations['bid_adjustments']['adjustment_percentage']}%")
```

## Account Management

The account management structure is the core organizational principle of Echelon:

### Account Structure

Each account has its own isolated directory under `src/accounts/` with a standardized structure:

```
ðŸ“‚ account_X/
â”‚â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ campaigns/                    # Campaign management
â”‚â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ budget/                       # Budget management
â”‚â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ optimization/                 # Account-specific optimizations
â”‚â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ alerts/                       # Alert configurations
â”‚â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ reports/                      # Reporting functions
â”‚â”€â”€ ðŸ“œ settings.json                 # Account settings
```

### Campaign Management

**Purpose**: Provides tools to create and manage various campaign types.

**Key Functions**:
- `SearchCampaignCreator`: Creates and configures Search campaigns
- `create_campaign()`: Creates a new campaign
- `create_ad_group()`: Adds ad groups to a campaign
- `add_keywords()`: Adds keywords to an ad group
- `create_text_ads()`: Creates ad creatives

**Use Case**:
Campaign management tools let you create and modify campaigns programmatically. For example, you could create a weekly sale campaign based on a template.

```python
# Example: Creating a search campaign
from src.core.api_client import GoogleAdsApiClient
from src.accounts.account_1.campaigns.create_search_campaign import SearchCampaignCreator

client = GoogleAdsApiClient(config_dir="config", account_id="123-456-7890")
creator = SearchCampaignCreator(client, config_dir="config")

# Create a new search campaign
campaign_id = creator.create_campaign(
    campaign_name="Summer Sale 2023",
    budget_amount=100.0,
    bidding_strategy="MAXIMIZE_CONVERSIONS",
    status="PAUSED"  # Start as paused for review
)
```

### Campaign Retriever (`retrieve_campaigns.py`)

**Purpose**: Retrieves existing campaigns and applies optimization workflows.

**Key Functions**:
- `CampaignRetriever`: Main class for retrieving campaign data
- `get_campaign_list()`: Gets a list of campaigns in the account
- `get_campaign_details()`: Gets details for a specific campaign
- `optimize_campaign()`: Applies AI optimization to a specific campaign

**Use Case**:
When working with existing campaigns, this tool helps you retrieve and optimize them.

```python
# Example: Getting campaign details
from src.core.api_client import GoogleAdsApiClient
from src.accounts.account_1.campaigns.retrieve_campaigns import CampaignRetriever

client = GoogleAdsApiClient(config_dir="config", account_id="123-456-7890")
retriever = CampaignRetriever(client, config_dir="config")

# Get campaign details
details = retriever.get_campaign_details(campaign_id="1234567890")
print(f"Campaign name: {details['campaign'].get('name')}")
```

### Account Settings (`settings.json`)

**Purpose**: Stores account-specific configuration and preferences.

**Key Sections**:
- **Account Info**: Basic account identification
- **Optimization Settings**: Thresholds and limits for AI optimizations
- **Bidding Settings**: Default bidding strategies and amounts
- **Targeting Settings**: Default geographic and language targets
- **Notification Settings**: Alert preferences and contact info
- **Reporting Settings**: Report configuration

**Use Case**:
Settings provide account-specific configuration without changing code. For example, one account might set more aggressive optimization thresholds than another.

```json
// Example settings that limit budget increase to 20%
"optimization_settings": {
    "max_budget_increase_percent": 20
}
```

## Bulk Operations

Tools for performing operations across campaigns in an account:

### Account Optimizer (`account_optimizer.py`)

**Purpose**: Handles AI optimization across an entire account, with human review.

**Key Functions**:
- `AccountOptimizer`: Main class for account-wide optimizations
- `generate_recommendations()`: Creates recommendations for all campaigns
- `display_recommendations()`: Shows suggestions in a visual format
- `review_and_apply_changes()`: Interactively applies approved changes

**Use Case**:
When you want to review and potentially apply optimizations across your account, this tool shows you suggestions in a tabular format and lets you approve each change individually.

```python
# Example: Reviewing and applying optimization suggestions
from src.bulk_operations.account_optimizer import AccountOptimizer

optimizer = AccountOptimizer(account_id="123-456-7890")

# Generate recommendations for all campaigns
optimizer.generate_recommendations()

# Display recommendations in a tabular format
optimizer.display_recommendations()

# Interactively review and apply changes
results = optimizer.review_and_apply_changes(interactive=True)
```

### Demo AI Suggestions (`demo_ai_suggestions.py`)

**Purpose**: Demonstrates AI optimization suggestions in a visual format.

**Key Functions**:
- `main()`: Runs the demo, showing AI suggestions in a tabular view

**Use Case**:
This is a user-friendly way to view all AI suggestions for an account in a tabular format.

```bash
# Example: Running the demo script
python -m src.demo_ai_suggestions --account "123-456-7890" --save "recommendations.json"
```

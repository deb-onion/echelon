# Echelon Google Ads Management System: Complete Project Overview

## What is Echelon?

## How Echelon Works: The Architecture

### 1. Frontend (User Interface)
Located in the `frontend/` directory, this is what users actually see and interact with.

- **Technology**: React, Material UI, Chart.js
- **Key Pages**:
  - Dashboard: Overview of performance metrics
  - Campaigns: List and management of all campaigns
  - E-commerce: Shopping performance and product data
  - Merchant Feed: Product feed health monitoring (newly added!)
  - Optimization: AI-powered suggestions
  - Settings: Configuration and account details

### 2. Backend API
Located in the `api/` and `src/` directories, this is the "brain" that talks to Google.

- **Technology**: FastAPI (Python), Google Ads API Client
- **Key Components**:
  - Authentication: Secure Google API connections
  - Data Processing: Transforms Google data for the frontend
  - Optimization Engine: AI algorithms for campaign improvement
  - Merchant Center Client: Connects to product data (new!)

### 3. Database
Stores configurations, user preferences, and cached data.

- **Contents**: Does not store actual Google Ads data (for security compliance)
- **Purpose**: Saves settings, custom rules, and application state

### 4. Deployment
- **Frontend**: Hosted on Cloudflare Pages (fast global delivery)
- **Backend**: Containerized with Docker, can run anywhere

## How to Use Echelon: Basic Workflow

1. **Login**: Authenticate with your Google account that has access to Google Ads
2. **Select Account**: Choose which Google Ads account to manage
3. **Dashboard**: View key performance metrics across all campaigns
4. **Campaign Management**: Create or modify campaigns
   - Use templates for quick creation
   - Apply AI suggestions for optimization
5. **E-commerce Toolset**:
   - Create Shopping campaigns
   - Monitor product feed health
   - Optimize product performance
6. **Apply Changes**: All modifications sync back to Google Ads

## Common Tasks Made Easy
